This is a desktop application designed to help users free up valuable disk space by removing duplicate images from selected folders. Our application uses machine learning technology based on convolutional neural networks to accurately detect and remove duplicate images with an accuracy rate of up to 90%. With a user-friendly Graphical User Interface, the application is easy to use for people with any level of technical knowledge.

We have integrated the PySide 5 library to build a modern and intuitive GUI, providing a seamless user experience. This application also provides users with peace of mind by saving deleted images to a MongoDB database using the PyMongo library, ensuring that no data is lost accidentally. Additionally, we have implemented a recovery feature, which stores deleted photos in a separate folder, making it easy to locate and recover if necessary.

Our application is built with a strong focus on data cleaning, providing users with a simple and efficient way to manage their disk space.
